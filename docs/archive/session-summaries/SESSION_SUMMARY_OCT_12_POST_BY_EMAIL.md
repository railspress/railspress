2. **Encrypted Passwords**: Passwords stored in `SiteSetting` (recommend encryption)

## 📊 Benefits Over WordPress

| Feature | WordPress | RailsPress |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| IMAP Support | Basic | Full SSL/TLS |
| HTML Emails | Limited | Full support |
| Attachments | Basic | Advanced (ActiveStorage) |
| Error Handling | Basic | Comprehensive logging |
| Manual Check | No | Yes (Check Now button) |
| Status Monitor | No | Real-time status card |
| OAuth2 Ready | No | Yes (extensible) |

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No OAuth2 by Default**: Uses password auth (can be extended)
2. **No Duplicate Detection**: Same email can create multiple posts
3. **Image Attachments Only**: Other file types not auto-attached (extensible)
4. **No Category Parsing**: Cannot parse categories from email body (yet)
5. **Fixed Check Interval**: 5 minutes (customizable in schedule.yml)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **OAuth2 Support**: Gmail, Outlook OAuth integration
2. **Smart Category Detection**: Parse categories from email tags/headers
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Check for existing posts with same title
4. **Rich Formatting**: Better HTML parsing and cleanup
5. **Email Templates**: Predefined formats for consistent posts
6. **Multi-Author**: Map sender email to author automatically
7. **Draft Review UI**: Bulk review interface for email-created drafts
