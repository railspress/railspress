# Nordic Minimal (Liquid CMS Theme)

Scandinavian minimal theme inspired by WordPress Twenty Twenty-Five. Calm typography, generous white space, strong focus on content.

## Structure
See the folders for layout/templates/sections/snippets/assets. JSON templates enable full-page editing; sections provide modular blocks.

## Quick start
- Map routes from `config/routes.json`
- Expose collections to Liquid: posts, pages, categories, tags, authors
- Serve assets from `/assets`
- Render with `layout/theme.liquid` as your default layout
