## 📝 Notes

### Dynamic Routes System
The plugin now uses a completely self-contained routing system:
- Routes defined INSIDE the plugin file
- NO modification of `config/routes.rb` required
- Routes automatically loaded on plugin activation
- Routes removed on deactivation
- Fully portable and modular

### Architecture Improvements
1. **Plugin Base Enhanced** - Added `register_routes(&block)` method
2. **Plugin System Enhanced** - Added dynamic route loading
3. **Initializer Updated** - Auto-loads plugin routes
4. **Documentation Complete** - Full guide in `docs/plugins/DYNAMIC_ROUTES.md`

### Database Tables
Using `sf_` prefix (Slick Forms) instead of `ff_`:
- `sf_forms` - Form configurations
- `sf_submissions` - Form submissions
- `sf_entry_details` - Individual field values
- `sf_logs` - Activity logs

### Next Steps
1. Create Slick Forms (free version)
