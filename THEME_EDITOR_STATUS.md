# Theme Editor Status

## What Was Fixed

1. **Controller Updates**
   - Fixed `data-controller` from `theme-editor-tabs` to `theme-editor`
   - Fixed data attribute names to use kebab-case (e.g., `current-file-value`, `current-content-value`)
   - Added `open_file` action for file selection
   - Fixed layout to use 'editor' instead of 'editor_fullscreen'

2. **JavaScript Controller**
   - Fixed data attribute access in `theme_editor_controller.js`
   - Changed from `this.data.get('fileContent')` to `this.data.get('current-content-value')`
   - Changed from `this.data.get('currentTheme')` to `this.data.get('current-theme-value')`
   - Changed from `this.data.get('fileExtension')` to `this.data.get('file-extension-value')`
   - Changed from `this.data.get('filePath')` to `this.data.get('current-file-value')`
   - Added debug logging

3. **View Templates**
   - Created `_editor.html.erb` partial
   - Updated `index.html.erb` to use the editor partial
   - Fixed file tree links to use `admin_theme_editor_file_path`
   - Removed duplicate Monaco script tag

4. **Layout**
   - Created proper `editor.html.erb` layout
   - Added Monaco Editor, SweetAlert2, and proper CSS/JS includes
   - Fixed full-height layout with proper overflow handling

5. **Routes**
   - Added `get :file, to: 'theme_editor#open_file'` route
   - Route: `/admin/theme_editor/file?file=path/to/file`

## How It Should Work

1. User visits `/admin/theme_editor`
2. File tree is displayed on the left
3. User clicks on an editable file
4. File opens in Monaco Editor on the right
5. User can edit and save the file

## Testing

To test:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/admin/theme_editor
2. Click on any editable file (blue icon) in the file tree
3. Monaco Editor should load with the file content
4. You should be able to edit and save

## To Debug

Check browser console for:

- "Initializing Monaco Editor..."
- "Monaco Editor is available"
- "Monaco container found"
- "Creating Monaco Editor with options"
- "Monaco Editor created successfully!"

If Monaco doesn't load, check:
- Network tab for Monaco script loading
